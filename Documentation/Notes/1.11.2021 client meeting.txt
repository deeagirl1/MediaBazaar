We are speaking to the manager
He wants overviews, stats, salaries per employee per year, statistics related to products etc

Different contracts: full time, part time (40 hours/12 hours)
If there's gaps in schedule it is filled with shifts of 8 hours.
Shifts:
morning 7-3
after 3-11
night 11-7
Couple of shifts per week, can't go over how many hours they have in contract.
If not enough employees, call employees from pool, they have 0 hour contracts
Admin can fill in the schedule
Admin assigns employees to shifts (Monday morning etc)
Should not be possible to assign to many shifts
No more than 10-12 hours a day (check law)
2 adjacent aren't possible

employees can indicate that they dont want to work and when they dont want to work (or cant)

Employees can signal if they prefer night shifts or not


Privacy sensitive information (we need encryption)
We keep track on excel sheets lots of excell sheets employees products information no link between sheets

employee: first name, family name, address, email, account (user:pass), DOB
they make schedule on whiteboard

more than 1 meeting in semester

a couple of steps, in the end we have emoloyees, customers, admins, manager that will use software app

first 6 weeks we work on c# application for administrator, mainly managinig data, can add new employees etc, modify vaious information, deleting not needed (active/not active, started working/not started yet) (but maybe add for Outstanding)


idea: have a "start work on" system for employees
employees just use website to change some personal data
employee types: cashier, janitor etc
admin should be able to schedule employees for workshifts



after week 6 we have meeting and discuss managing products/managing products in stock 
week 7 website for employees
